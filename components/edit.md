1 make sure that after the user fill the grnt form and submitted display a a load for few sec and display the message that we have recieve their details that we will get back to them within 2-3 working dayse and give them this as a note that while filling the form they should keep the password and email because that is what they wil use to get passkey that will be used to track their grants 

like i have said the user have an account display that after 24hrtheir account will be updated after 24hr and after that 24hr put the amount the user enter when filling the form but maksure you display the amount e entred when filling the form immidiately the 24hr is complted but make it pending then after that you can nw start the count down for 14 days start with count down for the 24hr then after 24hr you can now start the 4 days count down with a pending balace ten you update the notififcation make sure the notification is vissible atthe top left of the user account 

also when the user click on settings in the grant account the informatin displayed is not perfect som text and button was moved to the to and some was moved to the button which is difficult to see on both mobile and desktop make it fit screen size dont push anything out 

also the message displayed after the user login is not placed in the centre make it in the centre top to make it more advanced do the same for the copy message
